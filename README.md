# OpenSesame
These are behavioral scripts I've programmed in OpenSesame (http://osdoc.cogsci.nl).

## AQ Questionnaire <br/>
This is a version of the autism-spectrum questionnaire that can be used to devise an autism quotient (e.g., <a href='http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0074746' target='_blank'>Yu et al., 2013</a>; <a href='http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005653411471' target='_blank'>Baron Cohen et al., 2001</a>). Each participant rates their level of agreement with each statement on a scale of 1-4, from strongly disagree to strongly agree, using the numbers 1-4 on the keypad. Each statement is assigned a subcategory (e.g., Attention Switching), a polarity value indicating whether agreement is indicative of a more autistic-like response, and whether the participant response fits in that category or not.
Time: 15-30 min

## AX-CPT (Counterbalanced)
The AX-CPT task (e.g., <a href='http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0149-7634(02)00067-2' target='_blank'>Braver and Barch, 2002</a>) is a type of continuous performance task where participants are required to respond to letters presented on the screen in isolation in sequences of five. The first and last letter (a cue and a probe) are red, while the three fillers in the middle are white. Participants respond NO to all conditions but one: when the probe is an X and the cue was an A, the participants must press YES on the X probe. The trials are weighted to favor a proactive strategy, such that A cues are paired with X probes for 70% of the trials. The remaining three trial types are evenly balanced at 10% each: (1) AY trials, where the cue is A but the probe is not X; (2) BX trials, where the probe is X but the cue was not A, and (3) BY trials, where neither the cue nor the probe meet the criteria. Errors in (1) are related to proactive control, while errors in (2) are related to reactive control.

This task is based on the AX-CPT task used at the <a href='http://memory.ugr.es/' target='_blank'>Memory and Language Group</a> at the Universidad de Granada (one of Penn State's <a href='http://pire.la.psu.edu/' target='_blank'>NSF PIRE</a> partners).

Time: 15-30 min

## Digit Span (Sequential)
This is a standard digit span task, where participants see a sequence of numbers on the screen and then are asked to recall those numbers from memory in order. The sequence ranges from 3-9 letters, increasing gradually.

Time: 15-30 min

## Picture-Word Interference paradigm for DMC
This is a modified version of the picture-word variant of the Stroop task, based on Gonthier et al.'s (<a href='10.3758/s13421-016-0591-1' target='_blank'>2016</a>) paradigm (available <a href='osf.io/b9zyv/' target='_blank'>here<a/>). Proactive control is measured through list-wide congruency manipulations, while reactive control is measured through item-specific manipulations. The version here is a reduced version of Gonthier et al.'s paradigm; the reduction was to facilitate the inclusion of this and other cognitive control tasks to complement a linguistic experiment.

Time: 30-45 min

# English verbal fluency
This is a standard verbal fluency task used in the <a href='https://bilingualismmindbrain.com/' target='_blank'>Bilingualism: Mind and Brain Lab</a> at UC Riverside (formerly at Penn State University). In this task, participants see a broad semantic category on the screen and, upon hearing a beep, name as many members of that category as possible in 30 seconds.

Time: 10-15 min

# <i>n</i>-back task with lure trials
This is a version of the <i>n</i>-back task which includes lure trials. In the standard task, participants see a sequence of letters and are required to indicate if a certain letter occurred <i>n</i> letters ago (e.g., two letters ago, three letters ago). Lure trials, where a copy of the letter in an incorrect position (either <i>n</i>-1 or <i>n</i>+1), disrupt processing and increase false-alarm rates. In this version, participants complete a two-back block followed by a three-back block. Importantly, the sequence order is fixed at five in this version in order to promote a proactive strategy.

Time: 15-30 min
